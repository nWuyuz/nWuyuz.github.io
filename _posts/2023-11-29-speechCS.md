> 题目：电脑对生活或者产业造成的正面以及负面影响


AI is getting hotter and hoter these days, since [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) was brought into the public sight in 2022.

As a [digital native](https://huangxuan.me/2015/03/25/digital-native/), we should get used to the rapid revolutions of technology. 

I started to study the use of the bot with [langchain](langchain.com) and python. 

Of course I am really glad to see the trend that the machines are taking over many boring jobs from human, but I believe that **it is time to try and get things under control**.

In terms of art, we have [midjourney](midjourney.com) and [DALLE](labs.openai.com) 

As the human moderator are constantly **feeding** the machine correctly, we can just ask the bot to complete a absolutely masterpiece with the bot **within a blink**.

After I spent some time in the midjourney discord server, **I found it quite scary**.

# Repeated Works Are Not Artworks

![](/img/in_post/01.png)

This is the "art piece" I found in the midjourney showcase.

Great huh?

This is because the moderators constantly feed fresh pictures and words **from their web spider**.

I know some people learning art and **post their drawings online**.

So their artwork is litrally free for the companies like OpenAI and midjourney to feed them into their machines.

This is getting us human beings into big trouble.

Taiwanese game produce Rayark just fired fourty-six artists from their company because they are **replacing their designing department with the bot, as it is cheaper and faster**

***However the machine is fed with the work of the artists.***

Without feeding new works into the machine, **AI can not create their own ideas.** ***（Please proove me wrong in the future)***

If the artists eventually give up drawing, all the pictures in out world would be split into two categories:

**Old pictures from hundreds of years before**

and

**Pictures by the machine being similar to each other**

***Because the machine live on the artists and the machine itself is killing the artists!***

When you open pixiv you will probably see one in three drawings by AI.

# I DONT NEED THE STUPID MACHINE TO DESIGN EVERYTHING FOR ME!

I was looking to build my own blog site since I was 13. It finally happened last year.

When I had my hands on Google, I found several site sellers.

Right after I finished signing up, there is a instant pop up:

```

Hi Nathan,

Would you like to try out our auto-designed webpage layout by the newest AI technology?

```

***HELL NAH.***

***I don't need that stupid machine to teach me how to be creative***

I instantly gave up looking for a third-party site, and built my own within a week without spending a penny thanks to [Hux](huangxuan.me)

***Code language like CSS, JS, Go and PY are disigned for human to edit and write!***

If I need a machine to help me code something, isn't it easier for the machine to use machine code because it is designed for the machine to read?

# General Intelligence?

I want someone to stand up and slap me for this subtitle in my face during my lifetime.

As a human, I am designed to be destable in my mind and the low stability is creating creativity.

The machines are just too perfect to think out of its code.

As what I have said, [I believe in machine learning not general intelligence](https://nwuyuz.github.io/2023/11/09/gamble/).

Relying on the bots and machines will stop civilization growing, as it is not self-aware and it can not create anything.

What's worse, the version of GPT we have today is litrally making everything up when it comes to some specific question.

It is really good at faking an idea and abuse the trust we have on the database. 

It is really good at telling me that a sentense is right with referring different things that doesn't make sense.

***I learn computer science for the joy of creating things, not destroying civilizations***
