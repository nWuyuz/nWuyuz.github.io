> 题目：电脑对生活或者产业造成的正面以及负面影响

# First Half

AI is getting hotter and hoter these days, since [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) was brought into the public sight in 2022.

As a [digital native](https://huangxuan.me/2015/03/25/digital-native/), we should get used to the rapid revolutions of technology. 

I started to study the use of the bot with [langchain](langchain.com) and python. 

Of course I am really glad to see the trend that the machines are taking over many boring jobs from human, but I believe that **it is time to try and get things under control**.

In terms of art, we have [midjourney](midjourney.com) and [DALLE](labs.openai.com) 

As the human moderator are constantly **feeding** the machine correctly, we can just ask the bot to complete a absolutely masterpiece with the bot **within a blink**.

After I spent some time in the midjourney discord server, **I found it quite scary**.

## Repeated Works Are Not Artworks

![](/img/in_post/01.png)

This is the "art piece" I found in the midjourney showcase.

Great huh?

This is because the moderators constantly feed fresh pictures and words **from their web spider**.

I know some people learning art and **post their drawings online**.

So their artwork is litrally free for the companies like OpenAI and midjourney to feed them into their machines.

This is getting us human beings into big trouble.

Taiwanese game produce Rayark just fired fourty-six artists from their company because they are **replacing their designing department with the bot, as it is cheaper and faster**

***However the machine is fed with the work of the artists.***

Without feeding new works into the machine, **AI can not create their own ideas.** ***（Please proove me wrong in the future)***

If the artists eventually give up drawing, all the pictures in out world would be split into two categories:

**Old pictures from hundreds of years before**

and

**Pictures by the machine being similar to each other**

***Because the machine live on the artists and the machine itself is killing the artists!***

When you open pixiv you will probably see one in three drawings by AI.

## I DONT NEED THE STUPID MACHINE TO DESIGN EVERYTHING FOR ME!

I was looking to build my own blog site since I was 13. It finally happened last year.

When I had my hands on Google, I found several site sellers.

Right after I finished signing up, there is a instant pop up:

```
Hi Nathan,
Would you like to try out our auto-designed webpage layout by the newest AI technology?
```

***HELL NAH.***

***I don't need that stupid machine to teach me how to be creative***

I instantly gave up looking for a third-party site, and built my own within a week without spending a penny thanks to [Hux](huangxuan.me)

***Code language like CSS, JS, Go and PY are disigned for human to edit and write!***

If I need a machine to help me code something, isn't it easier for the machine to use machine code because it is designed for the machine to read?

01000110 01010101 01000011 01001011 01011001 01001111 01010101 00100001

## General Intelligence?

As a human, I am designed to be destable in my mind and the low stability is creating creativity.

The machines are just too perfect to think out of its code.

As what I have said, [I believe in machine learning not general intelligence](https://nwuyuz.github.io/2023/11/09/gamble/).

Relying on the bots and machines will stop civilization growing, as it is not self-aware and it can not create anything.

What's worse, the version of GPT we have today is litrally making everything up when it comes to some specific question.

It is really good at faking an idea and abuse the trust we have on the database. 

It is really good at telling me that a sentense is right with referring different things that doesn't make sense.

***I learn computer science for the joy of creating things, not destroying civilizations***

# Second half

> The second part, continued in 2023.11.30

As what I have said before, ***I don't believe in AGI, I believe in machine learning***.

I want someone to stand up and slap me in my face for this sspeech during my lifetime.

People called the thing out there **"Artificial Intelligence"**, but they don't know what they are talking about.

The ChatGPT there is just something fed with the whole internet with their web spiders.

And my positive story on the LLMs are about them being machine learning algorithms.

## Use of LLMs we have today

What we have today is the machine being given priorities of generating answers with [rlhf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback#:~:text=In%20machine%20learning%2C%20reinforcement%20learning,reinforcement%20learning%20(RL)%20through%20an).

This is useful because although it will not get awareness with rlhf ( good for safety reasons ),

**It is somehow improving itself**

We can use it to reduce the heavy investments of unnececery employments ( hopefully not me ) by letting the bots to deal with large sets of data.

## What can happen if AGI is achieved

> ***If AGI can be achieved in my lifetime, I don't care about its fancy functions, I care about human beings being replaced by the machines.***

If general intelligence can be achieved, what is the use of us being useless human beings?

The first thing I would have my hands on is the safety.

> I stopped speaking here as imagine beyond machine learning and trying to assume that AGI has been achieved is against my personal belief.

> This is continued by Mr. OB

## Finally, some sesible use of machine learning in our real life

When we are surfing online, we often see some stupid questionaires popping up.

```
What is your personalities?

Try our test out!
```

This only takes a click to complete, and people are reposting after so more and more people are involved.

A company called [Cambridge Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica) is dealing with the data collected.

They feed your question and answer to feed into their algorithm to study the thoughts of human beings.

This can further be used to brain wash people when it comes to politics.

When UK leaves EU, they hired CA to brainwash them. No good for people, but CA helped and worked.

When Trump was elected, no one thought he would be the winner. but CA hwlped and worked.

This is both good and bad.
